# DIC: Deep Image Clustering for Unsupervised Image Segmentation
# 1. My previour work on deep clustering:
We have won two championships for MS-SSIM and MOS in [CVPR 2018 CLIC image compression challenge](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018_workshops/papers/w50/Zhou_Variational_Autoencoder_for_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)  
We have won four championships for MS-SSIM, MOS, PSNR and Transparent Track [CVPR 2019 CLIC image compression challenge](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/papers/CLIC%202019/Zhou_End-to-end_Optimized_Image_Compression_with_Attention_Mechanism_CVPRW_2019_paper.pdf)

# 2. Prerequisites for runing DIC codes
```
Install pytorch and run demo_DIC_bsd.py
